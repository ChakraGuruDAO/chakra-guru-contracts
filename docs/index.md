# Solidity API

## Ownable

_Contract module which provides a basic access control mechanism, where
there is an account (an owner) that can be granted exclusive access to
specific functions.

By default, the owner account will be the one that deploys the contract. This
can later be changed with {transferOwnership}.

This module is used through inheritance. It will make available the modifier
&#x60;onlyOwner&#x60;, which can be applied to your functions to restrict their use to
the owner._

### _owner

```solidity
address _owner
```

### OwnershipTransferred

```solidity
event OwnershipTransferred(address previousOwner, address newOwner)
```

### constructor

```solidity
constructor() internal
```

_Initializes the contract setting the deployer as the initial owner._

### owner

```solidity
function owner() public view virtual returns (address)
```

_Returns the address of the current owner._

### onlyOwner

```solidity
modifier onlyOwner()
```

_Throws if called by any account other than the owner._

### renounceOwnership

```solidity
function renounceOwnership() public virtual
```

_Leaves the contract without owner. It will not be possible to call
&#x60;onlyOwner&#x60; functions anymore. Can only be called by the current owner.

NOTE: Renouncing ownership will leave the contract without an owner,
thereby removing any functionality that is only available to the owner._

### transferOwnership

```solidity
function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public virtual
```

_Transfers ownership of the contract to a new account (&#x60;newOwner&#x60;).
Can only be called by the current owner._

### _transferOwnership

```solidity
function _transferOwnership(address newOwner) internal virtual
```

_Transfers ownership of the contract to a new account (&#x60;newOwner&#x60;).
Internal function without access restriction._

## Context

_Provides information about the current execution context, including the
sender of the transaction and its data. While these are generally available
via msg.sender and msg.data, they should not be accessed in such a direct
manner, since when dealing with meta-transactions the account sending and
paying for execution may not be the actual sender (as far as an application
is concerned).

This contract is only required for intermediate, library-like contracts._

### _msgSender

```solidity
function _msgSender() internal view virtual returns (address)
```

### _msgData

```solidity
function _msgData() internal view virtual returns (bytes)
```

## Box

### value

```solidity
uint256 value
```

### ValueChanged

```solidity
event ValueChanged(uint256 _value)
```

### getValue

```solidity
function getValue() external view returns (uint256)
```

### setValue

```solidity
function setValue(uint256 _value) external
```
